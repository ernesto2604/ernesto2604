# Hi, I'm Ernesto 👋 

### BSc (Hons) Software Engineering Student @ York St John University | CS Graduate (DAM) | AI & Secure Solutions Developer

I am a solution-oriented developer specializing in bridging the gap between **complex data, secure backend architectures, and scalable cloud infrastructures**. With a solid technical foundation from my Associate Degree (DAM) and my internship at the **IT Innovation Department (CEU)**, followed by my current **BSc (Hons)** studies in the UK, I focus on building **AI-driven, cloud-native, and security-conscious software** to solve real-world challenges.
