* **Tech Stack:** OpenAI API, **Azure**, **Docker**, Structured XML Prompting, SQL, Python.
* **Impact:** A scalable, conversational interface providing data-driven academic recommendations and progress tracking.

#### 📍 Smart Location Alarms (Android)
* **Concept:** A Flutter-based application that triggers alarms based on geographic location.
* **Innovation:** Integrated **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to allow users to set alarms using voice commands.
* **Tech Stack:** Flutter, Dart, AI Voice Integration (Gemini/OpenAI), Geolocation APIs.
